## Functions as patterns :rainbow:

Exploring patterns as a means of understanding and documenting functions.

Inspired by the work of Alex McLean ([@yaxu](https://github.com/yaxu)) using visual patterns to explain the live coding language Tidal:
[Tidal Pattern Language for Live Coding of Music](https://www.academia.edu/467099/TIDAL_PATTERN_LANGUAGE_FOR_LIVE_CODING_OF_MUSIC)

[online resource](http://smcnetwork.org/files/proceedings/2010/39.pdf)
### Install:

Add to your project.clj file:

```
[functions-as-patterns "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

### Example:

```clojure
(require 'functions-as-patterns.core :refer :all)

(view-as-colors 
  (partition 3 (range 10)))

(view-as-colors
  (partition-all 3 (range 10))))
```

#### `(partition 3` ![Argument](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josephwilk/functions-as-patterns/master/doc/clojure.core%24partition_arg1.png))
***;;=>***
![Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josephwilk/functions-as-patterns/master/doc/clojure.core%24partition_post.png)

#### `(partition-all 3` ![Argument](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josephwilk/functions-as-patterns/master/doc/clojure.core%24partition_all_arg1.png))
***;;=>***
![Result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josephwilk/functions-as-patterns/master/doc/clojure.core%24partition_all_post.png)

## Api:

```clojure
;;Render to file, assume arguments are colors
(render "/tmp/" (partition 2 (hues 10)))

;;Render to file, convert arguments to colors
(render-as-colors "/tmp/" (partition 2 (range 10)))

;;Render assuming arguments are colors
(view (partition 2 (hues 10)))

;;Render mapping arguments to colors
(view-as-colors (partition 2 (range 10)))
```
