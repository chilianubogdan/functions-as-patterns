## Functions as patterns :rainbow:

Exploring patterns as a means of understanding and documenting functions.

Inspired by the work of Alex McLean ([@yaxu](https://github.com/yaxu)) using visual patterns to explain the live coding language Tidal:
[Tidal Pattern Language for Live Coding of Music](https://www.academia.edu/467099/TIDAL_PATTERN_LANGUAGE_FOR_LIVE_CODING_OF_MUSIC)

### Install:

Add to your project.clj file:

```
[functions-as-patterns "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

### Example:

```clojure
(require 'functions-as-patterns.core :refer :all)

;; If you want rendered images also going to disk
(set-dir! "/tmp/") 

(view
 (partition 3 (hues 10))))

(view
 (partition-all 3 (hues 10))))

```
